PDFLib is a simpler, more OO interface to pdflib, available
from http://www.pdflib.com/

It makes creating PDFs from perl fast, easy and safe.

Currently it supports text, images, graphics, and getting/setting all
parameters. It has builting support for several paper sizes.
It also takes care of starting/ending new pages, to try and
make sure that a valid PDF file is always created (though
unfortunately I think it's still possible to create an invalid
PDF with this module).

This is free software, you may distribute it under the same
terms as Perl itself.
